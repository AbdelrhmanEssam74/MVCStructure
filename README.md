# MVCStructure

## Project Overview (not finished yet)

**MVCStructure** is organized using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, promoting separation of concerns by dividing application functionality into **Models**, **Views**, and **Controllers**. This layout enhances the project's maintainability, scalability, and readability. The project structure also includes routing, configuration, validation, and asset management for building a full-featured web application.

## Installation

To set up **MVCStructure** on your local environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdelrhmanEssam74/MVCStructure.git
   cd MVCStructure
   ```

2. **Install PHP Dependencies**

   Ensure [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is installed, then run:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Install Node.js Dependencies**

   Install Node.js dependencies for static assets (e.g., CSS, JavaScript):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```


5. **Run the Application**

   Navigate to the `Public` directory and start the PHP server:

   ```bash
   cd Public
   php -S localhost:800
   ```

   The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:800`.

## Usage

The **MVCStructure** project follows the MVC pattern to structure the application, with each major component serving a distinct purpose:

- **Models (`App/models/`)**: Handles data logic and communication with the database.
- **Controllers (`App/controller/`)**: Manages application logic, processes incoming requests, and determines which views to render.
- **Views (`views/`)**: Renders user interface templates, organized with layout and partial templates for reusability.
- **Routes (`routes/`)**: Defines application routes and maps them to specific controllers and actions.

For instance, adding a new route might look like:

```php
// routes/web.php

Route::get('/', [HomeController::class, 'index']);
```

This route definition would map a GET request to `/home` to the `index` method in the `HomeController`.
